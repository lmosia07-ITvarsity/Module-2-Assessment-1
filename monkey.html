                        <h3>MONKEY</h3>
        <p>Monkeys live in trees, grasslands, mountains, forests, and on high plains. A group of monkeys is called a troop. Most primates share six basic features: forward-facing eyes, eye sockets, grasping hands, nails, fingerprints, and large brains. Monkeys are most easily distinguished from apes by their tails.</p>
        <p>In fact, researchers have found that monkeys will trade things, laugh, play, and accept food and water from people who imitate them. Researchers have also found that monkeys imitate others because it's a sign of affection that helps to create a relationship with the imitator and other animals.</p>
        <p>Monkeys are omnivores. This means that they eat meat and plant-based foods. Most monkeys eat nuts, fruits, seeds and flowers. Some monkeys also eat meat in the form of bird's eggs, small lizards, insects and spiders.</p>                
                        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
        <p>You will find the monkeys at pen E16, right next to the lions's pen.</p>
