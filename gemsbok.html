                        <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
    <p>The Gemsbok is the largest species in the Oryx genus. At the shoulder, they stand around 1.2 m (3.9 ft). [7] [8] The body length varies from 190 to 240 cm (75 to 94 in), with a tail length of 45 to 90 cm (18 to 35 in). [9] Female gemsbok weigh 100–210 kg (220–460 lb), whereas males weigh between 180 and 240 kg (400 and 530 lb).</p>
    <p>Gemsbok live in herds of about 10–40 animals, which consist of a dominant male, a few nondominant males, and females. They are mainly desert-dwelling and do not depend on drinking water to supply their physiological needs. They can reach running speeds of up to 60 km/h (37 mph).</p>                    
    <p>The gemsbok is generally a grazer but changes to browsing during the dry season or when grass is sparse. It may dig up to a meter deep to find roots and tubers, supplementing its water intake by eating wild tsama melons and cucumbers, which can provide all the water required (3 liters per 100 kg bodyweight and day).</p>
    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gemsboks at pen E21, right next to the elephant's pen.</p>
