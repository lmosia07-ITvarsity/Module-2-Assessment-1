                        <h3>LION</h3>
        <p>Lions are the only cats that live in groups. A group, or pride, can be up to 30 lions, depending on how much food and water is available. Female lions are the main hunters. While they're out looking for food, the males guard the pride's territory and their young.</p>                
        <p>The lion is a large felid of the genus Panthera native mainly to Africa. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane</p>
        <p>Mass: Male: 190 kg (Adult), Female: 130 kg (Adult)</p>
        <p>An adult maleâ€™s roar can be heard up to 8km away.</p>   
        <p>A female lion needs 5kg of meat a day. A male needs 7kg or more a day.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
        <p>You will find the lions at pen E17, right next to the koala's pen.</p>
