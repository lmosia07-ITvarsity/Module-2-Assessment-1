                        <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
    <p>The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns</p>
    <p>Giraffes are the tallest mammals on Earth. Their legs alone are taller than many humansâ€”about 6 feet.</p>
    <p>They can run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances, or cruise at 10 mph over longer distances.</p>
    <p>A giraffe's neck is too short to reach the ground. As a result, it has to awkwardly spread its front legs or kneel to reach the ground for a drink of water.</p>
    <p>Giraffes only need to drink once every few days. Most of their water comes from all the plants they eat.</p>
    <p>Giraffes spend most of their lives standing up; they even sleep and give birth standing up.</p>
                        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the giraffes at pen E20, right next to the gemsbok's pen.</p>
