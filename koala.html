                        <h3>KOALA</h3>
        <p>The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear, is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats, which are members of the family Vombatidae.</p>                
        <p>Cuddly critters, koalas measure about 60cm to 85cm long, and weigh about 14kg.</p>  
        <p>Although you may have heard people call them koala ‘bears’, these awesome animals aren’t bears at all – they are in fact marsupials. A group of mammals, most marsupials have pouches where their newborns develop.</p>
        <p>When an infant koala – called a joey – is born, it immediately climbs up to its mother’s pouch. Blind and earless, a joey uses its strong sense of touch and smell, as well as natural instinct, to find its way.</p>              
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
        <p>You will find the koala at pen E18, right next to the gorilla's pen.</p>
